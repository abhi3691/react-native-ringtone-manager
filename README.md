# react-native-ringtone-manager

Setting ringtones programatically is not available in iOS unfortunately. iTunes has it's own ringtone store available and there is no public API for setting ringtones. This library is for Android only.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-ringtone-manager
```

## Usage

```js
import { multiply } from 'react-native-ringtone-manager';

// ...

const result = await multiply(3, 7);
```
